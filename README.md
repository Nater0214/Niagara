# Niagara v1.0.0

I designed this for you because I was bored. Also because its fun. I hope you like it! Create an issue if you want me to change or fix something.  
If you are going to try and comprehend the code, use context to figure out long lines such as line 18 in dates.py and line 27 is stats.py  
You can watch progress on the [working branch](https://github.com/Nater0214/Niagara/tree/working)  
I will merge the progress to the [main branch](https://github.com/Nater0214/Niagara/tree/main) every time I finish a new full version
