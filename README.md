# Niagara v1.0.1

If you are going to try and comprehend the code, use context to figure out long lines such as line 18 in dates.py and line 27 is stats.py  
You can watch progress on the [working branch](https://github.com/Nater0214/Niagara/tree/working)  
I will merge the progress to the [main branch](https://github.com/Nater0214/Niagara/tree/main) every time I finish a new full version
