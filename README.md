# Niagara v1.0.0

Here is a simple tracker for the end of your sentences. Feel free to look through the code (thats why its here after all). Any big changes I make will be added to a branch prefixed with `working`. Whenever I finish that change, I will merge it into the main brach and it will say bye-bye. Some quick changes may be commit directly to the main branch.  
If there are any issues or features you would like added, then create an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Nater0214/Niagara/issues) with the appropriate label.  
Feel free to share this with whoever, it helps me make it better with more feedback.

## Installing
Download the latest version to the side (or an old version if you want for some reason), extract, and there you go! You should probably make a shortcut to the main.exe file, so its easier to run.
